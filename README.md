# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the initial steps and documentation for performing requirement analysis in a software development project.  
The purpose is to define, document, and manage the software requirements for building efficient and scalable systems.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

### Importance in the SDLC:
- **Clarifies Needs:** Helps developers and clients reach a shared understanding of the system's requirements.
- **Reduces Errors:** Early detection and clarification of requirements reduces costly changes later in development.
- **Improves Planning:** Provides a clear scope which aids in estimating time, resources, and budget.
- **Guides Design & Testing:** Acts as a baseline for software design, development, and validation.

In short, effective requirement analysis ensures that the final software product aligns with user expectations and business goals.
