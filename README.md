# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the initial steps and documentation for performing requirement analysis in a software development project.  
The purpose is to define, document, and manage the software requirements for building efficient and scalable systems.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

### Importance in the SDLC:
- **Clarifies Needs:** Helps developers and clients reach a shared understanding of the system's requirements.
- **Reduces Errors:** Early detection and clarification of requirements reduces costly changes later in development.
- **Improves Planning:** Provides a clear scope which aids in estimating time, resources, and budget.
- **Guides Design & Testing:** Acts as a baseline for software design, development, and validation.

In short, effective requirement analysis ensures that the final software product aligns with user expectations and business goals.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a critical role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that the final product meets the user's expectations and aligns with business goals. Here are three key reasons why it is essential:

- **Avoids Miscommunication:** Proper analysis ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project requirements, reducing misunderstandings and rework.
- **Improves Project Planning:** Well-defined requirements enable accurate estimation of cost, time, and resources.
- **Enhances Quality:** Clear and validated requirements result in a software product that is functionally correct and aligned with user needs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Here are the five key activities involved in the requirement analysis process:

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting information from stakeholders to understand what the system must do.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Engaging with users and stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires, and workshops to uncover real needs.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Clearly recording the requirements using specifications or user stories.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Organizing and analyzing the gathered information to identify conflicts, redundancies, or gaps.
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring all requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with business objectives.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do — the features and functions it must support.

**Examples (Booking Management System):**
- Users can create, update, or cancel a booking.
- Admins can manage listings and availability.
- The system sends booking confirmation emails.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system performs — including quality attributes such as performance, usability, and security.

**Examples (Booking Management System):**
- The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- The platform must be accessible from mobile devices.
- All data should be encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols.

## Use Case Diagrams

A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and the system. It helps in identifying system functionalities and the relationships among them.

### Benefits:
- Provides a high-level overview of system functionality.
- Enhances communication with non-technical stakeholders.
- Serves as a foundation for functional requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define specific conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be accepted by the end-user or stakeholder. It ensures that development aligns with business expectations.

### Importance:
- Provides clarity on what to build.
- Acts as a checklist for developers and testers.
- Prevents scope creep.

### Example (Checkout Feature in Booking System):
- The user must be able to view a summary of selected bookings.
- The system should allow secure payment through multiple methods.
- A confirmation message should be displayed after successful checkout.
- A confirmation email must be sent automatically after payment.
